This directory includes the files needed to train the parser
by reading in in treebank data and collecting the needed probabilities.

Note that while many of the files have the same names as those
of the parser, often they are slightly different and thus this
directory must be kept separate from that of the parser.

To execute the training regieme, execute

allScript -directory-for-data- -training-files- -development-files-

e.g.,

allScript /pro/dpg/hpp/dist6b/DATA/  "/pro/dpg/ecdata/cp/train.txt"  "/pro/dpg/ecdata/cp/test.main"

The directory where the data goes needs to contain the following
files.  Most (featInfo.*) tell the data collection programs exactly
what features to attend to.  terms.txt defines the noun-terminal and
pre-terminal symbols of the lanauge.  headInfo.txt states which
children catagories like to be the heads of which parent categories.
You will also need training data, e.g., the Penn Tree-bank, or
Switchboard, which is not provided.

All of the other files needed by the parser will be created
by runing allScript


LANGUAGE MODELING

To train the language model version using the featInfo files and rules.txt found
in DATALM.  

Also run allScriptLM rather than allScript.
