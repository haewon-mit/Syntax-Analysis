I do not wanna tell a story.
I'd rather listen.
I do not have any in my head.
Once upon a time there was a dinosaur named Lollipop and a dinosaur named Candycane and a dinosaur named Cookie.
This one will be Cookie.
Candycane.
This one is named Lollipop.
This one is named Candycane.
And they all lived in the pool.
The end.
Sometimes I like to say once upon a time.
Ever.
Not really.
But I like it.
It's hide and go seek.
Now I my cat Issac.
Green.
baby Green.
Yeah.
baby Green.
