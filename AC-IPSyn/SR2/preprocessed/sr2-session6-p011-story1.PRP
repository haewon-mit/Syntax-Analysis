once upon a time there was a prince.
And the party was good.
and then they all together.
and the princess and the croc were friends.
And even the prince and the croc were friends.
and they all came happily ever after.
and then they played hide and seek.
And then they.
He went to the party.
And then they all lived happily ever after.
