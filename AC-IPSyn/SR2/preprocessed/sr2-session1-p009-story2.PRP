One day there's a little girl who's swinging in the swing.
Then another girl wanted to play ball.
But she wanted to swing.
So she took the ball away and hid it there, at the swings.
And she made her legs not be able to reach.
And her fall off the swing.
And a boy said, "I want to play on the ball".
And so she went back on the swing.
And the girl , who wanted to play ball, forgot all about that.
Her played ball with the boy and.
The end.
