once upon a time the animals were happy.
and they live tree.
and they all play together.
and they played seek.
And one hid behind the back.
And one hid the bush.
and then they live.
And then a butterfly counted.
And he said, "one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve".
And he said, " ready or not, here I come".
and then he said, "found you, found you"!
The end.
