I'm stuck on the two girls that they used for.
Micah and Julia.
And they were supposed to swing on the swings.
And they did that every time they were out of school.
And they loved to eat.
And then they were on the swings.
And soon they were tired.
And they wanted to get off of them.
They wanted to go down.
And then their friend Mike came over.
They had just.
And they went back home.
Toot toot toot toot toot toot.
And they bring their balls.
Micah forget her ball because that was up high in a tree.
"I can not get either".
And Micah was happy again because she got her ball back.
I can not get the ball to move.
And their friend throw it down too and let them fall down.
And their ages were and.
She's.
He's.
And she's.
And she's.
They all went home for math from high school.
And they live in their ball because if they was.
They did not remember they were.
So the brother came down.
They went back down.
It was school time again.
The end.
