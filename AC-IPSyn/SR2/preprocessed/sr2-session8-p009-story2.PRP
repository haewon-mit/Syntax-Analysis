There was at the play structure.
Roll down.
roll down.
Roll down, roll down roll down roll down.
From then on he was one day they found a ball.
They kicked it up as high as they could.
it got burned by the sun.
"Oh no, what are we gonna do" said the little girl.
"I know" said the boy.
"Come back you balls".
A ball came back.
and then them.
And they all played ball.
The end.
