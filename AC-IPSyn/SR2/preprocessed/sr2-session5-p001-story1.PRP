Once there was three animals.
And a mama animal went inside to make cookie dough.
And the dad had to go to work.
So he took off.
And all there was is just the daughter.
She walked inside.
"Mom, what are you making"?
And then they saw a ship.
And they noticed that it was sinking.
And.
And they.
first.
Aw.
"Mommy, there tomorrow"?
And that was the story of three aliens.
