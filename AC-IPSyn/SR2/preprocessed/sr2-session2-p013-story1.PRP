Once upon a time there was a barn.
And there was a farmer that had all these different kind of animals.
And then he started playing.
And they saw that he had no that the farmer had.
And they started playing roughly.
And the farmer tryed to calm them down.
But they did not calm down because they are too hyper.
So the famer bought a sign that said that they should calm down.
And then the animals saw the sign.
And they calmed down.
