Once upon a time there was a bird and a dragon.
And they played in the sky.
And then they took a long walk.
And then they took a nap in the trees.
And then they played their toys.
And ) then they played hide and seek.
And then he smiled.
And somebody took a picture of them.
And then he.
And then the end.
